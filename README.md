# Bank Churn Machine Learning Predictor

## Project Overview

Utilized machine learning through scikit-learn to predict the outcome of whether banking customers were likely to churn . Implemented machine learning model by using a random forest algorithm to determine two types of classes in target vector: Churn or No Churn.
